# Curie-G Eternal Battery
A mod for the game Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Find a new use for that dangerous RTG that you pulled from the back of a coffeepot.

## New Tools:

RTG Fuel Cell - The radioactive guts of an atomic coffee pot, slowly charging a hextet of light batteries. Should provide battery power for a least a few years (1.3 battery units per minute, times about 7 years). Dangerous.

RTG Fuel Cell Mod - Allows most tool to run on the power provided by an rtg fuel cell.
